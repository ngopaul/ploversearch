# Plover Lookup with Highlighting

This is a simple local web page that serves a Plover dictionary 
and allows you to look up words in it. It highlights the strokes 
according to Plover theory, in the dictionaries that you provide.

The currently provided dictionaries are:
- `main.json`: The main dictionary from the Plover project.
- `commands.json`: The commands dictionary from the Plover project.

When running locally, you should add "user.json" to the local folder.
Then check `dictionary_order.json` to see the order in which the dictionaries are loaded.
